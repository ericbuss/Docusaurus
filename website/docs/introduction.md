## The next Docusaurus is coming to town

Docusaurus 1 used to be a pure documentation site generator. In Docusaurus 2, we rebuilt it from the ground up, allowing for more customizability but preserved the best parts of Docusaurus 1 - easy to get started, versioned docs, and i18n.

Beyond that, Docusaurus 2 is a **performant static site generator** and can be used to create most content-driven websites (e.g. Documentation, Blogs, Product Landing and Marketing Pages, etc) extremely fast.

While our main focus will still be helping you get your documentations right and well, the shared nature of building this static site generator makes it possible for you to build your whole website interface one-stop.

## You gotta love building your doc site

### ‚öõÔ∏è Built with üíö and React

Extend and customize with React, gain full control of your site's browsing experience by `swizzling` in your own components without having to build the whole site.

### üîå Pluggable

Bootstrap your site with a basic template, then pick and plug functionalities built by us and our community.

Open source your plugins to share with your fellow documentarians, because sharing is caring.

## Something Missing?

If you find issues with the documentation or have suggestions on how to improve the documentation or the project in general, please [file an issue](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) for us, or send a tweet mentioning the [@docusaurus](https://twitter.com/docusaurus) Twitter account.

For new feature requests, you can create a post on our [Canny board](/feedback), which is a handy tool for roadmapping and allows for sorting by upvotes, which gives the core team a better indicator of what features are in high demand, as compared to GitHub issues which are harder to triage. Refrain from making a Pull Request for new features (especially large ones) as someone might already be working on it or will be part of our roadmap. Talk to us first!
